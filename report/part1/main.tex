\section{Functional Programming with Structured Graphs}
\label{sec:paper}

This project is based on \textit{Functional Programming with Structured Graphs} by B. Oliveira and W. Cook \cite{oliveira2012functional}. The original work was published at \textit{ICFP '12: Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGPLAN Internal Conference of Functional Programming} \cite{icfp12}.

\textit{Functional Programming with Structured Graphs} presents a new functional programming model for generic graphs called \textit{structured graphs}. This model adds explicit definition and manipulation of \textit{cycles} and \textit{sharing}. The representation of cycles and sharing is implemented via \textit{recursive binders} and uses and encoding inspired by \textit{parametric higher-order abstract syntax}. The \textit{well-formedness} of the graph structure is ensured statically.
