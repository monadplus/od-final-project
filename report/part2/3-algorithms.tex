\subsection{Functional Property Graphs Algorithms}
\label{subsec:algorithms}

In this section, we show how to adapt common graph operations such as graph \emph{reachability} to functional property graphs. Adapting imperative graph algorithms to this representation is at least challenging and requires a deep understanding of fixpoint representations.

The following generalized operations are required in order to implement the common graph operations:

\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt,fontsize=\footnotesize, style=emacs,samepage=true,breaklines]{haskell}
sfold'
  :: (Eq t, Monoid t, Functor f)
  => (f t -> t)
  -> t
  -> Graph f
  -> t
sfold' alg k = gfold id (Foldable.fold . fixVal (repeat k)) alg
\end{minted}

\textbf{Reachability}\quad Reachability finds a walk between two nodes. The algorithm can be easily adapted to \emph{label-constrainted reachability}.

\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt,fontsize=\footnotesize, style=emacs,samepage=true,breaklines]{haskell}
acyclic :: (Eq a, Ord a) => Tree a -> Tree a
acyclic = go Set.empty where
  go visited (Tree v descendents) =
    let visited' = Set.insert v visited
        filterRec =
          fmap (go visited') .
            List.filter (\(Tree v' _) -> Set.notMember v' visited')
    in Tree v (filterRec descendents)

flattenF :: PropertyGraphF (Forest V) -> Forest V
flattenF (Node label props edges) =
  let adjacents = foldMap (\(Edge _ _ nodes) -> nodes) edges
      vertex = V label props
      tree = acyclic (Tree vertex adjacents)
  in [tree]

flatten :: PropertyGraph -> Forest V
flatten = sfold' flattenF []

findTree :: Eq a => a -> Forest a -> Maybe (Tree a)
findTree v = getFirst . foldMap (coerce . findNode) where
  findNode tree@(Tree a descendents)
    | a == v = Just tree
    | otherwise = findTree v descendents

reachability :: V -> V -> PropertyGraph -> Bool
reachability orig dest = go . flatten  where
  go :: Forest V -> Bool
  go forest = fromMaybe False $ do
    origin <- findTree orig forest
    _ <- findTree dest [origin]
    return True
\end{minted}
