\subsection{Future Work}

In this project, we managed to represent Property Graphs as a functional graph structure
based on a generic PHOAS representation and successfully implemented graph reachability. However, there are still many graph queries to be implemented such as shortest paths or graph isomorphism which are essential for property graphs.
