abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to Copenhagen for the 17th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming: ICFP 2012.This year's conference continues its tradition as a forum for researchers, developers, and students to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries. The call for papers attracted 88 submissions from the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe. The program committee accepted 32 papers that cover a variety of topics related to functional programming. In addition, the program includes three keynote talks: "Agda-curious?" by Conor McBride, "Tales from the Jungle" by Peter Sewell, and "High Performance Embedded Domain Specific Languages" by Kunle Olukotun. This year, for the first time, ICFP hosts an ACM Student Research Competition (src.acm.org) that attracted 14 submissions. This competition is a great way for young researchers to get in touch with the community. We hope that SRC@ICFP will become an ongoing event.As is tradition at ICFP, there was a programming contest this year, run by Kevin Hammond (co-chair), Edwin Brady (co-chair), Brian Campbell, Sam Lindley, Robert Atkey and Sam Elliott. This year 1,139 contestants participated in a three-day lambda-lifting extravaganza.ICFP offers a record number of 13 co-located symposia, workshops, and tutorials oriented towards both academics and practitioners: the Haskell symposium, the Workshop on Cross-paradigm Language Design and Implementation (XLDI), the Workshop on Generic Programming (WGP), the Workshop on Higher-Order Programming with Effects (HOPE), the Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Metalanguages: Theory and Practice (LFMTP), the Workshop on Scheme and Functional Programming (SFP), the Workshop on ML, the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop (OUD), the Erlang Workshop, the Haskell Implementors' Workshop (HIM), the Workshop on Functional High- Performance Computing (FHPC), the Tutorial on Compiler Construction in Haskell, and the Tutorial on the Grammatical Framework. Complementing this academic program is a three-day event for Commercial Users of Functional Programming that encompasses industrial strength one- and two-day tutorials as well as a full day of experience talks about functional programming in action.},
